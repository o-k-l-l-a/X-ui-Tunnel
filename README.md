🌐 Given the filtering in Iran, you can use this script to bypass the restrictions and achieve faster internet access. To do this, follow these steps:

1. **First**, run the script on a server outside of Iran. This script also has the capability to install WARP and by default selects Direct connection. To install, run the following command in the terminal of the server outside Iran:

    ```bash
    curl -0 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/o-k-l-l-a/X-ui-Tunnel/main/setup.sh | bash
    ```


2. **After the installation** on the external server is complete, run the same script on a server inside Iran and select the Iran option.

3. **Next**, use HAProxy to create a domain or subdomain record and set the external server's IP address behind it.

4. **During the installation**, apply these settings to easily and quickly connect to the internet and bypass the existing restrictions.

✨ By following these simple steps, you can easily bypass the filtering and enjoy faster internet access. 🚀
